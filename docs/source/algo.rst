Programming
=============

Introduction
*********

Programming is needed to accomplish the tasks to compete in the autonomous portion of the competition.

In a nutshell, computer programming is developing a set of instructions and encoding them into the computer such that the computer can carry out the instructions. The set of instructions or algorithms dictate how the computer will carry them out, and the translation/encoding makes the instructions understandable to the computer. From the description given above, 

Many people often fall into the trap of diving right into the actual coding of the computer rather than firmly developing the set of instructions or algorithms that it wants the computer program to execute. This is often times a trap as the programmer will most likely end up spending more time programming if they dove right into the coding. The process of programming compared to someone who spends some upfront time to fully define the instructions to which you want the computer or system to carry out. 

This section is divided into two sections: Algorithms and Software Engineering. The algorithms section is intended to help teams figure out how to properly fully define the instruction set they want the computer to carry out. The Software Engineering portion will dive into the the coding of the computer. 

It is impossible to teach everything there is about computer programming in a single web-page, so this page summarizes the important points that teams should understand and utilize to compete in the competition. Additional resources are given in the Resources section.

Finally, a walkthrough of the example code is given in the 2019-2020 Competition Specific Material section. The hope is that teams can use that example code as a starting point for developing their own path-planning code as outlined in the competition rules.

Algorithms
**********
Algorithms are defined as a set of instructions that allows the computer to accomplish its goal. These sets can be vary from very complex algorithms such as machine learning to AI or can be as simple as a calculation of a formula.

To demonstrate what an algorithm, we're going to use a cake receipe as an example.  

Different types of instructions:

* Do something/command
* Conditional
* Loops


Software Engineering
********************
Software engineering is at its core **the *TRANSLATION* of instructions to something a computer can understand**. Once the set of instructions or algorithms is defined above, the usage of computer languages is relatively straight forward. 

* Objects
* Functions
* Data Structures
