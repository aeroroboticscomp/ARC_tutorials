The whole point of this tutorial site is to allow teams to have a single source to begin looking for knowledge to help teams compete in the competition. Although most of this content has been written by a few of us from the ARC Staff, we would like to invite team members/teams to add to this source!!!

If you have any suggestions/contributions/corrections you would like to make to this website, please email us at aero.robotics.comp@gmail.com. We would love to hear from you!
