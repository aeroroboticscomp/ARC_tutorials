Flight Testing/ Operations
========================

Flight testing the quadcopter is the most important part of preparation for competition. Teams that fly often and practice often are the ones that do best. This page will walk through some basic testing as well as tips for getting the most out of testing. 

Ground testing
********
Before teams fly for the first time, ground testing can be done to make sure that all systems are working properly before attempting flight. Before attempting to fly, below are some tests that could be done to make sure the systems are operating properly:

WARNING: For all ground tests, **the propellers should not be attached to the motors. Only place propellers on motors when you are ready to fly**

- Motor spin test: Attach pieces of tape onto the motors to determine whether the motors are spinning in the right direction
- Motor throttle up: Ensure motors are increasing in power when you throttle up
- Familiarization with arming/disarming procedure: Ensuring you know when to arm and disarm the autopilots

Testing setup
********

There are two ways to do flight testing: flying indoors and flying outdoors. For both, tethering is highly recommended and will be required when flying at competition. There are many ways to securely tether the quadcopter. The two recommended ways are as follows:

- Two person tether: Tie two 20 ft long tethers on both sides of the quadcopter and have two people hold the quadcopter as the quadcopter is flying. This is more dangerous then the cinder-block tether; however, ideal for small scale flying when the operator is still learning how to fly.
- Cinder-block tether: This is the competition set-up. Tie a tether to swivel that is tied and held down by a cinder block. Place the cinder block in the middle of the field of flying.

Arducopter has made a very nice tutorial on how to achieve a good first flight here: http://ardupilot.org/copter/docs/flying-arducopter.html

**Please watch the videos and read through all tabs in the previous link before beginning testing.**


We also recommend having a testing checklist/order to help with testing safely. Below is an example testing line-up for some simple testing.

1. Make sure that at least a 20 ft x 20 ft area is blocked off. 
2. Everyone including those watching should have some form of eye protection (safety glasses are preferable)
3. DOUBLE-CHECK LIPO BATTERY FOR DAMAGE AND PUFFINESS BEFORE EACH FLIGHT
4. Attach two tethers on two sides of the quadrotor 
5. Have two safety officers (anyone) hold on to the tethers during flight.
6. Before turning on, make sure the propellers are on securely and tightened (tighten by passing a rod or allen wrench through the prop nut (cone thingy)).
7. Once the pilot determines that everyone is in place and in a safe distance, the battery can then be plugged in
8. Pilot needs to call out everything he/she intends to do so safety officers holding the tether know what to expect.
9. Flight test
10. Motor Spin-Up
11. Check that motors spin the same rate
12. Check that motors spin the correct direction
13. Takeoff and Hover at  around 4 feet 
14. Check that the quadrotor holds a semi-constant position without input
15. Proceed to fly forwards and backwards and side to side
16. Check that there is no bad thrust differential causing  a bad tilt or “toilet bowl” effect during flight
17. Proceed with flight safely
18. Once landed, make sure to disarm (hold yaw to left with throttle on lowest setting)

Having these checklists will ensure that proper procedure is followed and everyone is safe and unharmed in case something goes wrong. It is highly recommended that teams devise a checklist for flight testing as well as collect as much data (video, pictures, data logs, etc.) as possible to troubleshoot in case something goes wrong.


Simulation (optional)
********
The cheapest way to test in the most realistic setting is to set up a simulation that would simulate the flying virtually. This allows teams to test their program rigorously without any danger or risk to the quadcopter itself. However, setting up the simulation can be complicated; and therefore is only recommended for teams that have significant computer programming/systems experience. Below are some links that will help guide through the process. Please contact us if you have any questions. It is recommended that teams get flying before attempting to set up a simulation environment.
