Competition
**********
This year's competition continues to involve three portions of the contest: technical presentation, semi-autonomous, and autonomous flight rounds. The competition rules can be found here: `Rules <https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SzcAJrZ7H2ip-yEDGuqcqptYJDiAmbsZ/view>`_



Kit
******

This is intended to give teams a walkthrough on the parts that will be included in the kit. The kit was designed to be affordable to teams (~$600) while capable enough for the teams to accomplish the missions outlined in the competition rulebook. There are plenty of spares included in the kit to help teams deal with failures that will occur. Instructions are included in the following pages (see sidebar). 

The primary feature of this kit is the inclusion of two different autopilots. Both the APM 2.8 and the Pixhawk will allow teams to compete in the competition; however, the APM 2.8 is easier in that it performs the basic functions required where as the Pixhawk allows for advanced functionality if teams prefer to use that. The addition of another older yet capable system should allow teams to use the older system to learn how to fly the quadcopter without damaging more expensive equipment. **It is highly recommended that teams follow this practice.**

The above table is a headlined summary of the kit. A more detailed kit description will be available soon.

Please let us know if certain components are missing from your kit. Please check that your team has all the items required to compete! Teams should receive their kits by the end of October/beginning of November once the staff has verified that the first payment has come through.

Financial Plan
**********

ARC is an exciting and immersive experience where students will learn many facets of UAV operations. This year, teams can buy a kit. This will ease the hassle and allow teams to receive a fully flyable drone (assembly required) as soon as possible and focus on developing their competition plan and flying. The kit costs $600 and will be built into the financial plan described later. Teams however, are NOT required to purchase a kit, and can go out and purchase their own drone; HOWEVER, the drone MUST meet competition requirements to compete. Non-regulation drones will NOT be allowed to compete. The kit provided drone is designed/selected around competition requirements.

In order to fully experience ARC, teams need to have their quadcopter as early into the school year as possible. To allow this, teams who are selected to participate will immediately get their entire quadcopter kit (the ARC Kit) and be required to pay for it throughout the year. This will allow teams to fundraise throughout the year while still preparing for the competition with a fully functioning vehicle. Once a team is selected to participate they, along with their school leadership, are required to sign a financial agreement, below. They must submit this agreement with $100, non-refundable, at which time they will be sent their ARC Kit.

If a team is selected and does not send back a financial agreement within 5 calendar days they will be removed from participation. The following identifies the payment plan:


If a team decides they no longer want to participate they are simply asked to send back their ARC Kit and no more payments will be required. If a team has already made payments totaling over $700 they can keep their ARC Kit and will be refunded any money received over $700. If a team is late to make payments they must work with the ARC staff on an appropriate path forward. No team may be officially placed in a top 3 spot unless they have made payments in full.
