Aerospace Robotics Competition Tutorials!
=========================================

Aerospace Robotics Competition is a competitive program designed to teach high school students about aerospace engineering principles through designing, building, programming, and flying UAVs. The competition is structured as a combination of technical communication, student piloted flight, and autonomous flight through which students learn team leadership, hands-on vehicle design and and manufacturing, autonomous programming, and execution of design of experiments. With a multi-tiered mentor structure, students work with aerospace university students as well as industry professionals to be supported through the competition challenges and grow their network.
